About
------------------
'Text RPG!' was created to brush up on my python skills. As of this readme, 'Text RPG!' will be in development until the project has met all of its goals.
The base idea for 'Text RPG!' was based from the old school text based games. 'Text RPG!' uses CLI only, nothing more. Apart from a CLI color wrapper - ( Thanks Andre ! )
