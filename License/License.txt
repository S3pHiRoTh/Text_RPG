Text RPG is written by A.Taylor. This source is free to use in any of your projects, however, if you intend to use this source for any college/University projects please email me and i will be delighted to help. Emailing me for permission to use this source
in your educational projects enables you, to not include my name in the source. Effectively making you credible for this source AND its affliated class files ( Except andre's CLI color wrapper ) . 
If you think my code may be badly written, I'm not worried about bad code at this moment in time, as long as my code works, I'm a happy man. 
This project was written up to test my python programming skills, because i had been caught up with RL stuff ;-) .
